						Before joining Visa I did an internship in <h2 class="bold">Visa Labs</h2> mainly concentrating on distributed and graph database. Here is the summary of my work - 

						<ul>

							<li>Developed various Use Cases including geographical distributions and heat maps.</li>
							<li>Developed a mobile app to accept payments from paywave cards using NFC technology as a part of intern challenge</li>
						</ul>

						After Engineering I started working with <h2 class="bold">Tally Solutions Pvt Ltd</h2>, in the Research and Development Department(2011-2013). Following are the highlights of what I did in Tally - 
						<ul>
							<li>Researched on <h2 class="bold">Hadoop</h2> and its implementation in the company to process a large number of small sized XML files to get the approximate usage of each feature in the product.</li>

							<li>Made the reports real time by changing the database schema and using <h2 class="bold">NodeJs</h2>.</li>
							<li>Designed and Developed the first Mobile App that was used in the company. The app was developed using HTML5 and Javascript with <h2 class="bold">PhoneGap</h2> framework. App was used to assign and monitor the sales target to the partners. This led to creation of a dedicated mobile team.</li>

							<li>Hacking <h2 class="bold">mathquill</h2> library to customize to the needs of tutrr.com.</li>
							<li>Development of new types of editor (such as for prime factorization). This enabled us to cater to more types of mathematical problems.</li>
							<li><h2 class="bold">Native android application</h2> for tutrr platform. Done as Proof of concept, later led to a full scale development.</li>

						As written in About Me, I like to travel and read a lot and thus I am a very social person. I love to meet and know new people and hence I volunteered in <h2 class="bold">CommonWealth Games 2010,</h2> held at Delhi. I am also an active volunteer for <h2 class="bold">NUS ICare</h2>, to help international students feel home at NUS. I like to learn about knew things and hence you will find me more on quora rather than on facebook.
						Here are some of the blogs that I write - 
						<ul>
							<li><a target="_blank" href="http://naman.quora.com">naman.quora.com</a></li>
							<li><a target="_blank" href="http://namanagg.wordpress.com">namanagg.wordpress.com</a></li>
						</ul>
						I would like to write more,especially about my travel experiances and the things I develop.
						<br/>
						I have decided to put all my work online under MIT licence, so everybody can use and build on the code. Here is the link to my GitHub profile -
