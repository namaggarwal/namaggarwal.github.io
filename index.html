						Most recently I did an internship in Visa Labs at <span class="bold">VISA Inc.</span> mainly concentrating on distributed and graph database. Here is the summary of my work - 

						<ul>
							<li>Worked in Visa Labs on Distributed and Scalable Databases and Big Data.</li>
							<li>Did a standard Proof of Concept for using a Distributed Graph Database over Hadoop 2.x.</li>
							<li>Automated Proof of Concept deployment in Amazon Web Services.</li>
							<li>Automated Parsing and Bulk Data Loading of recent census data sets.</li>
							<li>Developed various Use Cases including geographical distributions and heat maps.</li>
							<li>Developed a mobile app to accept payments from paywave cards using NFC technology as a part of intern challenge</li>
						</ul>

						After Engineering I started working with <span class="bold">Tally Solutions Pvt Ltd</span>, in the Research and Development Department(2011-2013). Following are the highlights of what I did in Tally - 
						<ul>
							<li>Researched on <span class="bold">Hadoop</span> and its implementation in the company to process a large number of small sized XML files to get the approximate usage of each feature in the product.</li>
							<li>Developed an Interactive webapp to catch geographical(using <span class="bold">Google Maps API</span>) current and potential sales data. It received a personal appreciation from Bharat Goenka (known as father of Indian Software product industry).</li>
							<li>Designed(<span class="bold">UI and Database Schema</span>) and Developed new and interactive Sales/Reports which increased performance of upto 200%.</li>
							<li>Made the reports real time by changing the database schema and using <span class="bold">NodeJs</span>.</li>
							<li>Designed and Developed the first Mobile App that was used in the company. The app was developed using HTML5 and Javascript with <span class="bold">PhoneGap</span> framework. App was used to assign and monitor the sales target to the partners. This led to creation of a dedicated mobile team.</li>
						</ul>
						Later I moved to a Mettl (constantly rated as one of the top startups in India). The work that I did in Mettl were - 
						<ul>
							<li>Development of tutrr.com, from <span class="bold">Java and Postgresql</span> backend to writing <span class="bold">HTML,CSS and Javascript</span>. First release was a full revamp of website.</li>
							<li>Hacking <span class="bold">mathquill</span> library to customize to the needs of tutrr.com.</li>
							<li>Development of new types of editor (such as for prime factorization). This enabled us to cater to more types of mathematical problems.</li>
							<li><span class="bold">Native android application</span> for tutrr platform. Done as Proof of concept, later led to a full scale development.</li>

						As written in About Me, I like to travel and read a lot and thus I am a very social person. I love to meet and know new people and hence I volunteered in <span class="bold">CommonWealth Games 2010,</span> held at Delhi. I am also an active volunteer for <span class="bold">NUS ICare</span>, to help international students feel home at NUS. I like to learn about knew things and hence you will find me more on quora rather than on facebook.
						Here are some of the blogs that I write - 
						<ul>
							<li><a target="_blank" href="http://naman.quora.com">naman.quora.com</a></li>
							<li><a target="_blank" href="http://namanagg.wordpress.com">namanagg.wordpress.com</a></li>
						</ul>
						I would like to write more,especially about my travel experiances and the things I develop.
						<br/>
						I have decided to put all my work online under MIT licence, so everybody can use and build on the code. Here is the link to my GitHub profile - 
						<ul>
